The Terraform code creates the following resources in AWS:
* a VPC that has the name specified in the tfvars file
* public, private and protected subnet in each availability zone. The subnets were setup following recommendations from the following papers: [Practical VPC Design]( https://medium.com/aws-activate-startup-blog/practical-vpc-design-8412e1a18dcc) and [Building a Modular and Scalable Virtual Network Architecture with Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/vpc/architecture.html)
* Associated Routing tables for each of the subnets. The public subnet is associated with an internet Gateway while the private and protected subnets are associated with NAT Gateways
* Ability to create a single NAT gateway for the entire VPC or a NAT Gateway per Availability Zone. Creating a NAT Gateway per Availability Zone ensures High Availability but is more expensive to run (around $400/NAT Gateway instance). It is recommended to only use multiple NAT Gateways in Production.
* VPN Gateway that is attached to the VPC
